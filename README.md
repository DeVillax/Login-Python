# Login-Python
Simple login application on Tkinter. It uses a database (sqlite3) to store usernames and passwords, which are checked once the user enter 
its credentials.

1) Project Overview

Users will be prompted with a login screen with two buttons, a log in one and a sign up one. If an user does not have an account created
in the system, it will not be able to log into the system. Therefore, users can create an account by providing its first name, surname, username
and a password. Once the account is created, users will be able to log in succesfully.

2) Input Considerations

Inputs in this application are as follow:
  -Log in Frame
    -Username
    -Password
  -Sign up Frame
    -First Name
    -Surname
    -Username
    -Password
